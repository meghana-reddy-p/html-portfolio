<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello everyone,
  I'm Meghana, a passionate and curious Computer Science student specializing in Cyber Security at JNTUH, Hyderabad. 
</p>
 

<p>
  I recently began my journey in full-stack web development and have been enjoying every step of the learning process. Creating this portfolio using HTML was my first hands-on experience, and it sparked my interest in how websites come to life—from their visual design on the front end to the logic and functionality running behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>I’m particularly drawn to the creativity of front-end development and the problem-solving aspect of the back end. My goal is to continue building engaging, user-friendly websites while deepening my understanding of full-stack technologies.

  Alongside web development, I am also skilled in Java and continue to grow my knowledge in programming. I’m excited to keep learning, building, and contributing to the world of tech.</p>
